With this manual we want to document how the Python User Group Graz is organized
and how it operates. In here you will learn about the formats we use for our
meetups and how each meetup is planned.


## Communication channels

* [pygraz.org](https://pygraz.org) (canonical point of information)
* [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/PyGRAZ/) (events & event updated)
* [Mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/python-graz/) (discussions & announcements)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pygraz) (announcements)
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/101185345132127945047/101185345132127945047/posts) (announcements & discussions)


## Frequency of events

The user group meets every first Tuesday of each month. Exceptions are
explicitly announced through the mailing list, Twitter, and Google+.


## Formats

PyGraz at this point has the following formats:

* Long-presentation meetup
* Lightning talk meetup
* Coding dojo
* "Stammtisch"

If a venue is available supporting each kind we rotate the format in this order.


### Long-presentation format

The long-presentation meetup usually has one or two presentations with a 30-45
minute time window. Right after the previous event a call for proposals is sent
out and speakers are announced via Meetup.com.

Speakers should submit their proposals on pygraz.org.


### Lightning talk format

At max. five 10-minute talks are held. Right after the previous event a call for proposals is
sent out and speakers are announced via Meetup.com.

Speakers should submit their proposals on pygraz.org.


### Coding Dojo

Right after the previous meetup a call is sent out for suggestions on what to
experiment during this event. A single notebook is provided where one person
types and the other guides for 8 minutes, then then a new person is rotated in,
the guide becomes the coder and the coder re-joins the audience.

The topics being worked on are mostly libraries we want to explore or techniques
to learn.


### Stammtisch

Here we simply meet at a predetermined restaurant. A table is reserved 2 days in
advance and we use Meetup.com to get a rought estimate on for how many people we
have to make the reservation.


## Event Announcements

Scheduled events are currently announced by Horst Gutmann (@zerok) which
involves the following steps:

1. Check the [realraum calendar][] to see if the preferred date is still
   available and create an event if so. (only for non-Stammtisch events)
2. Creation of a new meetup entry on pygraz.org with information about what
   format will be used.
3. Creation of a meetup.com event and public announcement of that. This should
   always include a link back to pygraz.org as this is considered the canonical
   information point.
4. Advertisment of the event on Twitter and the mailinglist.

The announcement should be made at least 2 weeks before the actual event,
ideally earlier.
